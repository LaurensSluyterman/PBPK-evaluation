# PBPK-evaluation
This github contains two main files.

1. PBPK_evaluation.ipynb. This notebook can be opened in Google colab. With this file, confidence intervals can be easily calculated for PBPK parameters both using the individual and the group-level approach.
2. 2-fold_example.ipynb. This notebook demonstrates the shortcoming of the 2-fold approach: it is possible to accept or reject a model for small data sets when this should not be the case. The notebook also illustrates how a confidence-interval-approach would deal with these scenarios.
